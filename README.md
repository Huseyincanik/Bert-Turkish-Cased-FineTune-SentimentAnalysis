Cased BERT Fine-Tuning for Text Classification
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates fine-tuning a Cased BERT model for a text classification task. The model achieves 91% accuracy after training on the given dataset.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, padding, and encoding using Hugging Face's Transformers.

BERT Fine-Tuning: Implements a pre-trained Cased BERT model for classification.

Training & Evaluation: Uses a 91% accuracy model performance assessment.

Visualization: Includes loss and accuracy plots for better insights.
